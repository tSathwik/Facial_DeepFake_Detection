# Facial Deepfake Detection Using DenseNet121

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a deepfake facial detection system utilizing the DenseNet121 architecture. Deepfakes are synthetic media where a person in an existing image is replaced with someone else's likeness. This system aims to identify and distinguish deepfake images from authentic ones using a deep learning model.

## Dataset
The dataset we used was deepfake data set from Kaggle which contain 140k images of which 70k are real and 70k are deepfake images.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 
- Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip install.

## Features

- Utilizes the DenseNet121 architecture for feature extraction.
- Trained on a dataset of real and deepfake images.
- Achieves high accuracy in detecting deepfake images.
